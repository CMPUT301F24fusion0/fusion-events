## General Information
In the repository, you can find our Javadocs and our UML in a Draw.io format. This is to ensure that our files are self-contained and can be viewed in greater quality. For example, the UML's width is very large and ergo, it cannot be adequately displayed on the wiki. Therefore, please visit [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and add the [diagram](https://github.com/CMPUT301F24fusion0/fusion-events/blob/main/FUSION0%20UML%20FILE%20(DRAWIO).drawio) to view it in the highest quality possible.

The Javadocs `index.html` file can be found [here](https://github.com/CMPUT301F24fusion0/fusion-events/blob/main/Javadocs/index.html).
